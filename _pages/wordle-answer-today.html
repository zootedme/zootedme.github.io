  <h3 id="what-is-wordle-">What is Wordle?</h3>
  <p>
    Wordle is an online word-guessing game where the player has to guess a
    five-letter word in six attempts. The game presents a blank slate with five
    boxes representing each letter of the word. The player inputs a word into
    the boxes, and the game highlights each letter in green if it is present in
    the target word and yellow if it is in the wrong place.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to guess the target word within six attempts by using the
    feedback provided by the game. The game can be played for free on the
    website wordle.io, and players can compete with their friends or challenge
    themselves to improve their gameplay.
  </p>
  <h3 id="how-does-wordle-work-">How Does Wordle Work?</h3>
  <p>
    Wordle works by presenting the player with a blank slate and a five-letter
    target word. The player then inputs a five-letter word into the blank slate,
    and the game provides feedback in the form of green and yellow boxes.
  </p>
  <p>
    A green box indicates that the corresponding letter is present in the target
    word and is in the correct position. A yellow box indicates that the
    corresponding letter is present in the target word but is not in the correct
    position.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using this feedback, the player has to guess the target word within six
    attempts. If the player is unable to guess the target word within six
    attempts, the game ends, and the target word is revealed.

    Tips and Tricks for Playing Wordle
  </h3>
  <p>Here are some helpful tips and tricks that can improve your gameplay:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Start with vowels:</strong> As there are only five letters in the
      target word, starting with vowels can help narrow down the possibilities.
      This strategy can help eliminate a lot of the less common letters.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pay attention to the feedback:</strong> The feedback provided by
      the game is essential to make progress. Use it to your advantage to
      eliminate possibilities and narrow down the target word.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use common letter combinations:</strong> In the English language,
      some letter combinations are more common than others, such as
      &quot;th,&quot; &quot;ch,&quot; and &quot;sh.&quot; Using these letter
      combinations can help you make progress and narrow down the target word.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use process of elimination:</strong> As the game progresses,
      eliminate letters that have already been used in previous attempts. This
      strategy can help you narrow down the target word and make progress.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Keep a list of previously used letters:</strong> Keeping a list of
      previously used letters can help you avoid repeating letters and make
      progress towards the target word.
    </li>
  </ol>
